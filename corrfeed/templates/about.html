                     <p>   Everyone is familiar with how organizations claim they provide the best customer care service, how they resolve their customers' issues quickly, how they treat their customers warmly and it goes on and on, and you know the rest of the story, with no sort of statistics whatsoever to back their claims up.</p>
 <p>  However, most people believe, if not all depending on how hard the organization push, and those that don’t, perhaps encountered a few third-parties who have had a bad experience. Sadly enough, these third parties are just few out of many customers the organization transacts with, which makes it not really reliable to base your judgement on them.</p>
 <p>  But what if there was a place you could go, to look up an organization, look up how often their customers have issues, what kind of issue they mostly have, how far the organizations care to resolve those issues and compare it with similar organizations, tell us, how cool will that be to make a seemingly hard decision of which organization to go for? Yes, SUPER COOOOOOOOOOOOOOLL we know.</p>
   <p>And that’s where Prissue comes in, a platform to help you make wise decisions, so you don’t fall prey to anyone. Data are generated by customers that have experienced what you are contemplating to do, and as they say, 'Experience is the best teacher'.</p>
  <p> In order to achieve this our above aim, we need people to post their organizational issues here, give evidences of it and tell when they are resolved. Other people will rally around you, make your claim known to the organization concerned and have it resolved.</p>
  <p> It’s our own little way of making the world a better place from now on and centuries to come.</p>

Cheers,<br/>
The Prissue Mafia.
